Thank you for wanting to contribute to this project! We love open source projects and are very excited to now be doing our small bit for the community too.

Please take a moment to review our contributing guidelines, so this becomes a smooth process for both you and us.

## Code of Conduct
At Digital Art Lab we work hard to make everyone feel welcome and included, both online and offline. That's why we have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/digitalartlab/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect everyone (that includes us) to stick to this code and treat each other respectfully.

## Support questions
Please don't use our issue tracker for general Hyphenated support questions, only for questions related to Hyphenated NL.

## Reporting issues
Include the following information in your post:
- Describe what you expected to happen.
- If possible, include a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to help us
    identify the issue. This also helps check that the issue is not with your own code.
- Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there was an exception.
- List your Hyphenated and Hyphenated NL versions. If possible, check if this issue is already fixed in the latest releases or the latest code in the repository.

## Submitting patches
The Dutch language is a weird one, and we know this project doesn't always get things quite right. When necessary, we add an exception. That hard codes the hyphenation options for a specific word, but it doesn't scale well.

You can add those exceptions too! Just create a pull request with your suggestions.

When creating your pull request, please keep the following in mind:
- Keep pull requests focussed on a single issue, like adding in a few new word exceptions or fixing a bug
- Add your changes to the `Unreleased` part of the CHANGELOG

> You're can also update the actual hyphenation patterns, but that's only for very brave souls
